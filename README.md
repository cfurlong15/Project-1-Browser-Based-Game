With Concentration, a player is faced with a deck of cards, with each individual card placed face-down. The deck of 16 cards contains 8 matching pairs, all of which are shuffled randomly across the board. The goal of the game is to guess, but also hone your memory, to correctly match each pair. 

## Technologies Used
This game was developed with three key programming languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started 
To play Concentration, follow the link below, but be sure to read up on how to play first!

### How to Play
Click "Start" to shuffle the deck, then click on a card to flip it over and reveal its face, which in this case will be a color. Keep in mind, though, that you have a limited number of attempts to complete the grid. Every two card flips will register as an attempt, and if you successfully flip each pair within the specified limit, you win. Fail to do so, and the game ends. Win or lose, you always have the option to "Reset" the board, and "Start" again.

## Future Development
Although designed and functioning, this game is still in its early stages of development. Moving forward, I will continue to implement a number of changes, including: 

Appearance
- A larger game board containing a larger deck of cards.
- Images to further identify card faces.
- An animated flip, so that with each click, the card reveal has more style.

Functionality
- A point system, so those who are able to win in fewer attempts are rewarded accordingly.
- A timer to emphasize the stakes and require the player to work more quickly and carefully. 

### Thanks for playing!
